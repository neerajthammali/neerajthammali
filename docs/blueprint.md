## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep reddish-purple (#800000) to convey innovation and depth. This will provide a sophisticated feel aligning with a dark mode interface.
- Background color: Very dark grayish-black (#080808) to support the dark mode and make content stand out without being jarring.
- Accent color: Bright yellowish-orange (#FFC300) as an analogous accent to the reddish-purple. This will highlight interactive elements and CTAs with a vibrant, tech-forward feel.
- Body text: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif font, for readability and a modern feel. Use for body text.
- Headline text: 'Space Grotesk' sans-serif, suitable for headlines to make a techy impact
- Use minimalist, custom icons for sections and key elements. Icons should use the yellowish accent color.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout with a focus on whitespace for a minimalist aesthetic.
- Subtle transitions and hover effects to add interactivity without being distracting. Use animations to guide the user through the portfolio smoothly.
